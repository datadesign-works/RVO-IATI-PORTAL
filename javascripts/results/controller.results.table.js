Report direct and indirect (e.g. outgrower) jobs separately. Disaggregate by gender. Convert in Full Time Equivalents (FTE) pro rata, based on local definition of a working week.” However, some programmes (such as PSI) follow the former DCED definition and measure the number of additional (created) jobs. The exact definition on programme or project level can be found in the table below under ‘result indicator description’. '

        'description': 'The indicator ‘Number of companies with supported plans to invest or trade’ measures the number of companies which is or has been supported by means of a subsidy, financing or an assignment. In the case of an assignment, only the main contractor is included (companies which have signed a contract and/or received payments on behalf of the project). The total number of supported companies is thus larger in reality, because subcontractors may be hired (often local companies). State companies (more than 50% state owned) are not included under this indicator. The exact definition on programme or project level can be found in the table below under ‘result indicator description’. By aggregating the number of companies on project level, there may be some double counting since companies may be supported by more than one  project. The names of the companies are available on the project level under ‘project partners’. Under the project partners tab of this site, a list of all companies is available (project partner type: private sector), as well as information about the projects in which these companies are involved.

In the case of PPPs or public (infrastructure) projects, co-financing might also be provided by a local government, knowledge institutions, NGOs and foundations or other donors. (Impact investors are included under financial institutions if they are privately funded and under donors if they are donor funded.) Co-financing is not reported for each reporting period (due to high management costs), instead the total co-financing is reported at project completion. '
