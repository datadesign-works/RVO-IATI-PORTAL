#### IATI aiddata Portal for Netherlands Enterprise Agency, an agency of the Dutch government
--------
This is the Angular.JS User Interface for Netherlands Enterprise Agency.  The http://aiddata.rvo.nl/ portal has visualized the open data on official development aid projects and programmes executed by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland - RVO.nl). 

Programmes commissioned and funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On projects under implementation at or started after January 2015. The data is published in the international International Aid Transparancy Initiative (IATI) standard which is easy for computers to read, but very hard for humans. The information is made accessible through a web interface. It does not alter or interpret the data in any way.

This Angular.JS User Interface makes use of the data-engine [OIPA ](http://www.oipa.nl),  enabling IATI XML compliant data to be parsed and interfaced using the OIPA JSON API.

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATA XML standard at: www.iatistandard.org
