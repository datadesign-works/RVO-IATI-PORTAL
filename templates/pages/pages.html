		    <h2>What data can be found on this portal of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl)?</h2>
			<p>This portal visualizes  the open data on official development aid (ODA) projects and programmes executed by the <a href="http://english.rvo.nl/">Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl)</a> and commissioned and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment is co-financer of one programme. The information relates to projects that were either active on or started after January 2015.</p>
			<p>The data is published according to the <a href="http://www.iatistandard.org">International Aid Transparancy Initiative (IATI) standard</a>, which is easy for computers to read, but very hard for humans . The information is therefore made accessible through a web interface. It does not alter or interpret the data in any way. Additional non-IATI data on projects - as monitoring reports, photos and videos - is added regularly. </p>
			<p>By publishing this data on a website it becomes relatively easy to see which projects are being carried out for a particular country, sector or programme. It also makes it possible to see when, where and by whom projects are being carried out and how much money is being spent. In 2016, data on results (outcome) of projects will be added increasingly.</p>
			<p>The Netherlands Enterprise Agency publishes and updates its projects at least on a quarterly basis. The policy is that all project information should be published, unless there is a clear reason for not doing so. Only confidentiality of data or safety for staff executing a project can be a reason for not publishing data. This can be on individual pieces of information or the entire project.</p>
			<p>Data is visualized for 15 of the 20 ODA programmes which Netherlands Enterprise Agency is executing.</p>

			<h2>Why is open data important?</h2>
			<p>Transparency of development aid enhances the effectiveness and quality of development aid. Politicians, civil society, the media and the public get better insight into how public money is spent.</p>
			<p>Additionally, open data can be used as a communication tool, monitoring & evaluation tool, information and knowledge management system and create track records.</p>
			<p>Finally, visualisation of data will also alter the way Netherlands Enterprise Agency reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on goals and results of programmes and projects. </p>

			<h2>Data quality</h2>
			<p>Data quality is one of the major challenges. Traditionally the data comes from fragmented information stored in internal systems, used for reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Not with open publication in mind.)</p>
			<p>We believe that open data is not about the publication of perfect data - it’s about perfecting that data and the projects that it pertains to. As the culture of open data and transparency becomes embedded into the organisation, the quality and application of data will continue to improve.</p>
			<p>The financial data in this portal does not automatically synchronize completely with the finance &  control accounting system of RVO.nl. This system is always leading and more accurate.</p>
			<p>Despite all efforts, it is very well possible  that errors or imperfections are noticed in our data files. If so, don’t hesitate to let us know via <a href="mailto:iati@rvo.nl">iati@rvo.nl</a>.</p>
